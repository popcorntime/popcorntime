Popcorn Time is starting fresh. The project is being rebuilt from the ground up, and we need contributors to help shape this new era.

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a designer, a translator, or just someone who wants to test and give feedback - there's a place for you here.

## Code of Conduct

Popcorn Time follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
We expect all contributors to help create a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming environment.

---

## Ways to Contribute

No [Rust skills](https://www.rust-lang.org/) are required for most of these, if you can run the app and provide feedback, you can contribute.

### 1. Developers

- React/TypeScript: Most of the visible app is React. You don't need to know Rust to make meaningful contributions.

- Rust: If you want to dive deeper, there's plenty of work close to the metal: networking, system integration, performance.

### 2. Designers & UX

- Help refine the interface and overall user experience.
- Contribute mockups, interaction flows, or polish existing UI.

### 3. Translators

- Bring Popcorn Time to your language and region.

TODO: We leverage AI translations for now

### 4. Testers

- Run nightly builds.
- Report bugs, UI quirks, or performance issues.
- Suggest improvements based on real usage.

### 5. Documentation & Community

- Improve README, guides, FAQs.
- Help answer questions from new users and contributors.
- Share ideas about what features matter most.

---

## Contributing in Issues

If you find a bug, spot missing docs, or have an idea, open an issue.

---

## Pull Requests

- Small, focused PRs are easier to review and merge.
- If you're planning a large change, open an issue first to discuss.
- Add tests when needed.

---

## Commit Messages

We use conventional commit style for squash merges:

```
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle
fix(ui): resolve onboarding crash
docs: update installation guide
```

---

## Reviews

- Expect feedback. It's part of the process.
- Keep discussions focused and respectful.
- Incremental improvements are fine - PRs don't have to be perfect to land.

---

## Not Just Code

Popcorn Time is an open-source project, but it's not just about code. Translators, designers, testers, writers, and community members are equally important. If you're here, you're part of the process.
